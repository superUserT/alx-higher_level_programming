# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This project focuses on JavaScript, specifically exploring concepts related to objects, scopes, and closures. The project is scheduled to run from November 14, 2023, to November 15, 2023, with an auto-review set for the deadline.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand JavaScript object basics, object-oriented programming, and ES6 class features.
- Grasp the concepts of closures, prototypes, and the importance of variable type and scope.
- Learn how to inherit objects from one another in JavaScript.

**Project Structure:**
- The project involves completing various tasks, each designed to reinforce specific learning objectives.
- Tasks include defining and manipulating rectangles and squares, handling constructor scenarios, implementing methods for printing, rotating, and doubling rectangles, and creating functions for counting occurrences and reversing lists.

**Coding Standards and Requirements:**
- Code should be semistandard compliant, following rules of Standard with semicolons.
- Editors allowed include vi, vim, and emacs.
- All files must be executable.
- Length of files will be tested using wc.
- Usage of 'var' is not allowed.

**Setup:**
- Install Node 14 using the provided commands.
- Install the 'semistandard' tool globally using npm.

**Tasks Overview:**
1. **Rectangle #0:**
   - Define an empty Rectangle class using the class notation.

2. **Rectangle #1:**
   - Define a Rectangle class with a constructor that takes width (w) and height (h).

3. **Rectangle #2:**
   - Extend Rectangle #1 by handling cases where width or height is 0 or not a positive integer.

4. **Rectangle #3:**
   - Add a print() method to Rectangle #2 that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

5. **Rectangle #4:**
   - Extend Rectangle #3 with rotate() and double() methods.

6. **Square #0:**
   - Define a Square class that inherits from Rectangle #4.

7. **Square #1:**
   - Extend Square #0 with a charPrint(c) method that prints the square using the character 'c' or 'X' if 'c' is undefined.

8. **Occurrences:**
   - Implement a function 'nbOccurences' that returns the number of occurrences of a search element in a list.

9. **Esrever:**
   - Implement a function 'esrever' that reverses the elements of a list without using the built-in 'reverse' method.

10. **Log Me:**
    - Implement a function 'logMe' that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

11. **Number Conversion:**
    - Implement a function 'converter' that converts a number from base 10 to another base specified as an argument.

**Quiz Questions and Copyright:**
- The document includes a section on quiz questions and emphasizes the importance of avoiding plagiarism.

The Readme.md provides comprehensive information about the project structure, objectives, coding standards, setup instructions, and a brief overview of each task.

# Project Title

0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Description

This project focuses on Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using SQLAlchemy and MySQL. The main goal is to connect Python with databases, specifically MySQL, and utilize SQLAlchemy to simplify database interactions.

## Getting Started

Before starting the project, ensure that your MySQL server is installed and configured correctly. Follow the provided instructions to set up a Python Virtual Environment and install the required modules, including MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy.

## Background

The project introduces the concept of ORM, which abstracts the storage details, allowing developers to interact with databases using Python code rather than SQL queries. It emphasizes the advantages of ORM over traditional SQL queries and provides a comparison.

## Resources

The project includes a list of resources such as tutorials and documentation for MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy. These resources serve as references for understanding ORM syntax and best practices.

## Learning Objectives

The project aims to teach developers various aspects of Python programming and database interactions. The learning objectives include connecting to a MySQL database, executing SQL queries, understanding ORM, mapping Python classes to database tables, and creating Python Virtual Environments.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

The README emphasizes the importance of individual effort in completing the tasks and strictly prohibits plagiarism. It also outlines the consequences of violating these rules.

## Requirements

The project outlines specific requirements, including allowed editors, Python version, module versions, file structure, coding style, and documentation standards.

## Tasks

The project includes multiple tasks, each requiring the implementation of Python scripts that interact with a MySQL database. The tasks cover topics like retrieving data, filtering, avoiding SQL injection, and using SQLAlchemy for ORM.

# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

JavaScript Warm-up

This repository contains a set of JavaScript tasks and exercises that cover fundamental concepts and practical applications. The project aims to provide a solid foundation in JavaScript and prepares you for more advanced coding challenges. Below is an overview of the project and its contents:
Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for a variety of purposes, including scripting and web front-end development. In this project, you'll focus on scripting to learn the basic concepts of the language before applying your knowledge to a dynamic project.
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

    Understand why JavaScript programming is essential.
    Execute JavaScript scripts.
    Create variables and constants.
    Differentiate between var, const, and let.
    Recognize various data types in JavaScript.
    Use control flow structures, such as if and if...else statements.
    Write comments and manage variable values.
    Employ loops like while and for.
    Work with functions and understand return values.
    Manage variable scopes and handle arithmetic operations.
    Manipulate dictionaries and import files.

Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All scripts are interpreted using node (version 14.x)
    All script files must end with a new line
    The first line of each script file should be #!/usr/bin/node
    A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
    Code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x) with semicolons.
    All script files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

Usage

To run the JavaScript scripts in this project, you can use the following format:

bash

./script_name.js

For example, to run the script that prints "JavaScript is amazing," you can use:

bash

./0-javascript_is_amazing.js

Task Descriptions

The project contains various tasks that cover different JavaScript concepts and applications. Here is a brief overview of the tasks:

    Task 0: Print "JavaScript is amazing" using a constant variable.
    Task 1: Print three lines of text using console.log.
    Task 2: Print a message depending on the number of arguments passed to the script.
    Task 3: Print the first argument passed to the script or "No argument" if none are provided.
    Task 4: Print two arguments passed to the script in a specific format.
    Task 5: Print an integer or "Not a number" based on the first argument's convertibility to an integer.
    Task 6: Print three lines using a loop and an array of strings.
    Task 7: Print "C is fun" x times based on the first argument, or "Missing number of occurrences" if not provided.
    Task 8: Print a square of 'X' characters based on the first argument, or "Missing size" if not provided.
    Task 9: Print the addition of two integers provided as arguments.
    Task 10: Compute and print the factorial of an integer or 1 if not provided.
    Task 11: Find and print the second biggest integer from a list of arguments.
    Task 12: Update a JavaScript object's value from 12 to 89.
    Task 13: Create a function to return the addition of two integers, export the function, and use it in a separate script.
